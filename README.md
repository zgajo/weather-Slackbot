<h3>Slackbot which gives current weather</h3>
<h3>For exercise purposes I made exercise with 3 possibilities: </h3>
<ul>
    <li>Slash command: listens /weather command and takes city after command </li>
    <li>Incoming and outgoing webhooks: activated when word weather is called as first part of sentence</li>
    <li>Bot: activated when you call bot name and asks him weather ['Weather in *city*', 'weather in *city*', 'weather *city*', '*city* weather']</li>
</ul>
